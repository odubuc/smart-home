# Smart Home

Side project for fun to learn a new development platform.

## Phase 1 :
Replace the air exchanger wall unit by this code on a raspberry like device. My current "ÉdenAir" unit is really really bad.

## Phase 2 : 
Replace the thermostats with another PI like device.

## PHase 3 : 
If by that time I'm still not bored with this project, I'll move to garden and light control.
